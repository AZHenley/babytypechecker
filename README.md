# Baby Type Checker

A small type checker I made for Python as part of my blog post, [Baby's first type checker](https://austinhenley.com/blog/babytypechecker.html).

It is ~350 lines of Python that type checks a single Python code file. It supports primitive types, containers, functions, assignments, binary operators, indexing, type unions, and a few scenarios of type narrowing.
